Dogs and cats are generally considered senior at around 7 years old. Here's what to watch for and how to adapt their care.

## Weight and Appetite

- Monitor weight monthly—both gain and loss can signal issues
- Note any changes in appetite or eating habits
- Track treats and table scraps; seniors need fewer calories

## Mobility and Activity

- Watch for stiffness, limping, or reluctance to jump
- Shorter, more frequent walks may work better than long ones
- Provide ramps or steps for furniture if needed

## Vet Visits

- **Every 6 months** for wellness exams (instead of yearly)
- Bloodwork to check kidney, liver, and thyroid function
- Dental care becomes more critical with age

## At-Home Monitoring

Log these in Vet Record so you can spot trends:

- Energy level
- Sleep patterns
- Water intake
- Any lumps, bumps, or skin changes
