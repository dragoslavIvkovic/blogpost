Whether your pet needs daily pills for heartworm prevention or post-surgery antibiotics, consistency is key. Here are five tips that actually work.

## 1. Set Alarms at the Same Time Every Day

Pets thrive on routine. If you give medication at 8 AM and 8 PM, stick to it. Your body will start to expect it too.

## 2. Keep Pills Visible

> "Out of sight, out of mind" is real. Keep the pill bottle next to your coffee maker or toothbrush—somewhere you visit twice daily.

## 3. Use a Tracking App

Vet Record lets you set recurring reminders and log each dose. You'll never wonder "Did I give the morning pill?" again.

## 4. Prepare Weekly Pill Organizers

Sunday evening: fill a 7-day organizer. One less decision during the busy week.

## 5. Pair with a Daily Habit

Give the pill right after your morning walk or before your evening news. Habit stacking works.
