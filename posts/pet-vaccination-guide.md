Keeping your pet's vaccinations up to date is one of the most important things you can do for their health. This guide covers everything you need to know about vaccinating dogs and cats.

## Core Vaccines for Dogs

**Rabies** is required by law in most areas. Puppies typically receive their first dose at 12-16 weeks, with boosters every 1-3 years depending on your local regulations.

**DHLPP** (Distemper, Hepatitis, Leptospirosis, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza) protects against several serious diseases. The initial series starts at 6-8 weeks, with boosters every 2-4 weeks until 16 weeks old.

## Core Vaccines for Cats

**Rabies** is also essential for cats, especially if they go outdoors.

**FVRCP** (Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, Calicivirus, Panleukopenia) is the core combination vaccine for cats. Kittens receive their first dose at 6-8 weeks.

## Never Miss a Booster

Use Vet Record to track all vaccinations and receive reminders before they expire. Your pet's health records are always in your pocket.
