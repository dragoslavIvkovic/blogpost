A lot of pet owners ask their vets, "Is my cat too fat or too skinny?" It's not always enough to just look at cats to tell if they are healthy because they have fur and come in all forms and sizes.

It's very important to know what the right weight is for your cat based on their breed and stage of life. Even small changes in weight can be the first symptom of a serious sickness that is going on within.

## What is the typical weight of a house cat?

A healthy domestic cat should weigh between 8 and 10 pounds (3.6 and 4.5 kg). But this is only a broad starting point. The best weight for a cat depends a lot on its breed, bone structure, and genes. For one breed, a weight that is dangerously obese could be perfectly acceptable for another.

## The Best Cat Weight Chart by Breed

Here's a quick guide to prominent cat breeds that can help you figure out how much your cat should weigh:

| Type of Cat | Weight Range That Is Ideal (lbs) | Ideal Weight Range (kg) |
|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Home Short hair | 8–10 pounds | 3.6 to 4.5 kg |
| Maine Coon | 10 to 25 pounds | 4.5 to 11.3 kg |
| Ragdoll | 10 to 20 pounds | 4.5 to 9.0 kg |
| Persian | 7 to 12 pounds | 3.2 to 5.4 kg |
| Siamese | 5 to 10 pounds | 2.3 to 4.5 kg |
| Sphynx | 6 to 12 pounds | 2.7 to 5.4 kg |

*Note: Male cats of the same breed are usually bigger and heavier than female cats.*

## The weight of a cat changes as it gets older

As a cat gets older, their weight changes a lot.

### Kittens (0–12 months)

Kittens grow quickly. For the first six months of a kitten's existence, it should gain roughly one pound every month. A steady increase in weight is a sign of good growth.

### Adult Cats (1 to 10 years)

This is the phase of keeping things going. The weight of an adult cat should stay very consistent. The biggest danger at this point is slowly gaining weight because of eating too much and not getting enough exercise.

### Older Cats (11 years or more)

As cats get older, they generally lose muscular mass, which makes them lighter. But if your older cat suddenly or steadily loses weight, it's not just because they're getting older; it's frequently a sign of a medical problem.

## When Should You Be Worried About Your Cat's Weight Change?

Cats are known for disguising their suffering and disease. A change in their weight is often the only sign that something is wrong.

**If your cat loses or gains 10% or more of its total body weight for no apparent reason, it is a medical emergency.** To put this in context, a healthy 10-pound cat losing merely 1 pound represents 10% of their body weight. (For a person who weighs 150 pounds, that's like losing 15 pounds all at once!)

- **If you suddenly lose weight:** It could be a sign of hyperthyroidism, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, or a serious dental issue that makes it hard to eat.

- **Sudden Weight Gain:** Can mean that you're holding onto too much fluid (which is commonly linked to heart problems), that your hormones are out of whack, or that you're so tired that you need to change your diet.

## How to Keep an Accurate Record of Your Cat's Weight at Home

It's almost impossible to tell the difference between two cats that weigh 1 pound merely by looking at them or picking them up. It's easy to lose or forget mental notes and printed calendars between yearly appointments to the vet.

You should weigh your cat at home on a regular basis and keep track of the data together with their daily behaviors, such as their mood and appetite, to spot worrying trends before they turn into emergencies.

Using a dedicated digital tool like the Vet Record app is the best way to keep an eye on these important health parameters. Instead of making guesses, Vet Record lets you enter exact weight entries, keep track of what you eat every day, and get a comprehensive medical history on your phone right away. If your cat starts to lose weight for no reason, you may send your vet their whole digital health profile and weight curves right away. This will help them make a faster and more accurate diagnosis.
